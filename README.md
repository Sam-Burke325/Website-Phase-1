# Website-Phase-1

This phase 1 of my first website. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I build each page and so will likely create many mistakes and changes along the way.

I will update and commit changes to this repository whenever I feel I have made a considerable amount of progress to each webpage such as completing page layouts, cleaning up lines of CSS and adding or fixing animations.

The purpose of this first website is to improve upon my technical skills as a programmer/developer, build on my design skills, as well as showcase my abilities through project work and documents. This website will largely be focused on delivering information about myself and my work in a simple and straightforward manner moreso than exceed in UI/UX design given that this is my first website.

Upon completion of phase 1 of my website, I plan to focus on UI/UX development to improve the website and my abilities as a designer. This would include advancing aspects such as accessibility to find and navigate through the contents of the website, as well as clean up accessibility through various devices. Another addition would be interactible background animations that can showcase my improvement as a programmer, as well as make the website more lively and enjoyable to peruse through.

Development for phase 2 of my website is not likely to begin until phase 1 has completed and substantial feedback has been acquired.

As of right now, all of the files related to my actual website are in the Website Prototype I folder and every other folder holds files that I have created to learn HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. The folder called, "HTML Basics" holds an HTML file which shows basic syntax, structuring and other aspects of HTML that I have learned over the course of this development cycle while the Bootstrap Usage folder was my first attempt at using bootstrap to some extent. I will occasionally go back into each of those folders to refresh my memory about certain aspects of HTML and CSS should I ever forget. You are free to see my learning process and progression through each of those files but note that they do not contribute to the actual website I am developing.

To learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I largely use the internet to find documentations which can explain things I may not understand, to solve problems I may be running into to, and to figure how to achieve things I might not know how to do such as code for a navigation bar etc. I do not pay for any lessons and have found that video tutorials do not work as well for me as simply reading does.
I also found it very resourceful to seek out other people's website and inspecting their code to learn about various things such as common aspects of websites as well as how they went about accomplishing different CSS and HTML stylizations.
